                                        documentation) to our system and begin pinning photos
                                        onto corresponding drawings. Next, simply clip any

                                        you can ship out an email, completely organized, with

										                  <p>Every project has major milestones. Often times it is beneficial to photograph these moments. For example, I.C. Progress can document your MEP systems before insulation, sheetrock and ceilings are installed. Having these photos can save you time and money if you ever need to re-open the walls. It eliminates the guesswork of where problems may be hidden and can illustrate where the drawings fail to match with actual installation. You may also be interested in photographing pre-slab pours to document where various utilities lie within the slab. You can feel safe that our over-lapping photographic coverage will give you a good indication of where important utilities are if you ever need to chop into the slab.

Have one of our photographers visit your site to fulfill your contractual obligations to properly document and record your site through the demolition or build process.

				                        <p>Every project has major milestones. Often times it is beneficial to photograph these moments. For example, I.C. Progress can document your MEP systems before insulation, sheetrock and ceilings are installed. Having these photos can save you time and money if you ever need to re-open the walls. It eliminates the guesswork of where problems may be hidden and can illustrate where the drawings fail to match with actual installation. You may also be interested in photographing pre-slab pours to document where various utilities lie within the slab. You can feel safe that our over-lapping photographic coverage will give you a good indication of where important utilities are if you ever need to chop into the slab.

				                        <p>After project completion, it is a good idea to have I.C. Progress photograph the site to record visual proof of the building conditions as the project is turned over to the client. For instance, if your client has any doubts that you may be responsible for incomplete tasks or damages, you will have verifiable proof to the contrary.
