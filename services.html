				                        <p>An aerial perspective is instrumental in showing detail that cannot be seen from ground level. </p>

                                                          <p>Taking pictures across the deck of a new building does not demonstrate things like where utilities will be buried. Only when you get the camera high enough overhead can you really see some of these important details  With our new drones we can get closer to the action and provide unique perspectives that were previously impossible.

                            <p>A   colleague   introduced  me  to  IC    Progress    last    year    when    I   needed  specialized 
                            photos  taken   of  a   construction    site.       Since   meeting with    the owner   and his team,   I   
                            have    been    consistently    impressed   with    the level   of  professionalism they    use.        We  
                            now regularly   rely    on  their   promptness  and quality during all  phases  of  
                            construction.       We  have    also    begun   working with    them    to  show    our finished    spaces, 
                            for marketing   purposes.   The photos  always  turn    out beautiful   with    the right   color   
                            and image   resolution.</p> 
                            <p>Their   electronic  software    is  also    incredibly  organized   and user    friendly.       The site    
                            allows  you to  view    photos  in  a   way that    I   have    not seen    before.     It  is  a   brilliant   
                            system. </p>
                            <p>As  a   company,    we  have    been    nothing but pleased working with    IC    Progress.       I   have    
                            already recommended them    to  others  in  my  field,  and will    continue    to  do  so in   the 
                            future.&rdquo;</p></div>

                                IC Progress Photography. I have used IC Progress for two construction projects for the 

                                LIU Brooklyn Campus Capital Projects Department for construction progress photography and 

                                documentation. </p><p></p>Our department has begun to seeking photography documentation services 

                                after experiencing issues with the performance of work performed by general contractors that 

                                were procured by the university. In addition, such services were beneficial for university 

                                archival & recordkeeping. Other documentation firms fail to document or label photos that 

                                were taken on the field and lack the resources to pin documentation photos to an electronic 

                                construction document. We have engaged IC Progress photography for these particular 

                                services and are extremely satisfied customers. </p><p></p>Compared to other firms we have worked 

                                with, IC Progress will take the time to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our 

                                university senior administration. We look forward to appointing IC Progress for future
